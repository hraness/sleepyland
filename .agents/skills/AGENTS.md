# Guidelines

- Keep each skill self-contained with `SKILL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and matching `agents/openai.yaml` metadata.
- Keep trigger descriptions precise and workflows portable across repositories cloned from this template.
- Put deterministic repeated operations in tested scripts instead of asking agents to rewrite them.
- Preserve upstream attribution and license notices for adapted public resources.
- Update a skill's metadata and directory guide when its trigger, resources, or default invocation changes.
- Validate changed skill folders with the installed Codex skill validator when available, and run every changed script's focused tests.
